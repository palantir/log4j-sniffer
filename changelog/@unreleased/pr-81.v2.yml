    When not using `--file-path-only`, the following output behaviour has been modified.

    Each finding is now reported individually, rather than reporting
    an aggregation of all findings with only the top-level file on
    disk.

    For example, a vulnerable jar nested inside an archive will now be
    reported with the vulnerability findings, rather than reporting on
    the archive with an aggregation of all findings from within it.
    Multiple vulnerable jars found within an archive will be reported
    separately.

    The path reported with a vulnerability finding is the full path
    to a finding with archive layers delimited by a "!".
    i.e. /path/to/archive!path/to/finding.jar shows that an archive
    at /path/to/archive contained a vulnerable jar at
    path/to/finding.jar within it.

    When using `--json` mode, the path on disk is still reported
    as the `filePath` field. An extra `detailedPath` field has been
    added, containing the full path the the vulnerable content, which
    may be nested in any number of archives.
