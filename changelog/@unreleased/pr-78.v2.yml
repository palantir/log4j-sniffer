    A flag has been added to choose the behaviour of file opening used when opening archives on disk.
    The flag, `--archive-open-mode`, has supported values of "standard" and "directio", defaulting to "standard" when no value is supplied.

    Standard open mode will open files and read their content in the
    same way as before this PR, where the filesystem cache may be used.
    This has caused issues on some hosts, where the use of log4j-sniffer
    has resulted in many filesystem cache evictions during use.

    Direct i/o mode will use the O_DIRECT flag when opening archives on
    disk on linux systems, using similar primitives on other operating
    systems that allow for reading of the files to skip the cache.
