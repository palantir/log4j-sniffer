    Update output behavior

    Updates output behavior as follows:
    * Writes to stdout and stderr directly rather than using loggers
    * Removes metric loggers
    * In default mode, prints output in human-readable form with summary
    * Adds "--json" flag that, when specified, prints all output as structured JSON
    * Adds "--summary" flag that is enabled by default and, when set to false, does not print the summary
    * Updates crawler tests to test crawler behavior on examples
    * Updates crawl.Crawler.Crawl to return summary statistics
    * Updates cralwer.Crawl to take in crawler.Config struct instead of individual command-line options
    * Uses standard Go style for capitalization in variable names

    These modifications make it such that the project no longer has dependencies on witchcraft-go-logging
    or witchcraft-go-error.

    Fixes #15
