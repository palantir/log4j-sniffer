    Recursing into zip files is now supported up to a configurable depth, `--nested-archive-max-depth`. By default this is set to `0`, which means an archive on disk will have its contents inspected but an archive within it would not be unarchived for inspection.
    Nested archives will only be inspected if they are below a configurable size, `--nested-archive-max-depth`.
    To control memory usage for unarchiving, a combination of `--nested-archive-max-depth` and `--nested-archive-max-depth` should be used. This will only control the memory usage on top of the base memory usage of `log4j-sniffer`.
